We'll use next regular FE PA meeting call to create a humble clone of timbenniks.nl (any URL/IP address will do though - we probably don't want to buy a new domain for it)

Methodology as said will be Swarming:
1. We start with a common understanding of what is to be built, and what is out of scope
2. Everybody starts were s/he likes ~ feels most comfortable ~ wants to do and already has a bit of idea
3. We keep a list of tasks up to date. Little 1-ish hour tasks. Working on 1 and only 1 task at time per person. Pushing every 20-ish minutes.
4. ???
5. Success
